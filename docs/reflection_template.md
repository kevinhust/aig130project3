# Individual Reflection

## Cloud Platform Experience (GCP)
| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Integrated Ecosystem**: Vertex AI links seamlessly with GCS. | **Complexity**: IAM roles can be tricky to debug. |
| **AutoML Power**: Achieved high accuracy with zero model code. | **Cost**: Even idle endpoints cost money. |
| **Documentation**: Extensive guides available. | **UI Changes**: Console layout changes frequently. |

## MLOps Learnings
- **Automation**: CI/CD saves time but requires significant initial setup.
- **Reproducibility**: Docker ensures the embedding environment is consistent.
- **Metadata**: Vertex Pipelines tracks artifacts (datasets, models) automatically.
