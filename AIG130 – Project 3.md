 AIG130 – Project 3 

Introduction 

This project integrates the fields of MLOps, AutoML, and HuggingFace technologies into the development of a machine learning solution. You will experience the power of these tools in streamlining the development, deployment, and maintenance of ML models, focusing on efficiency, scalability, and performance. 

Objective 

- To architect and implement a machine learning pipeline using MLOps principles, AutoML tools, and HuggingFace for a specified problem. 
- To evaluate and select appropriate AutoML solutions and HuggingFace resources for this project, considering the project's specific needs. 
- To understand and apply best practices in MLOps for continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), and model monitoring. 
- To critically assess the impact of the solution in terms of performance, scalability, and ethical considerations. 



Group Formation 

Students can work individually or form groups of up to 4 members. Collaboration and effective communication are encouraged for those working in groups. 

Assignment 

1. Identify a real-world problem that can be addressed with an ML solution (limit it to methods that you have learned so far). Consider problems where the integration of AutoML and HuggingFace can bring value to the implementation. 
2. Design a machine learning pipeline that incorporates MLOps practices. Explain your design in the report. 
3. Implement at least two steps of the pipeline where AutoML and HuggingFace can be utilized (e.g., data preprocessing and/or model selection with AutoML, dataset and/or pre-trained model selection from HuggingFace). 
4. Demonstrate the pipeline's functionality, emphasizing the integration of MLOps, AutoML, and HuggingFace components. 



Deliverables 

**Report**: Submit a PDF report covering all tasks. Include: 

- An introduction and conclusion. 
- Sections for each task with headings. 
- Visual elements (charts, tables) where applicable. 



**Demo**: Prepare a video demo/presentation of your implemented solution. 

- Duration: Up to 15 minutes. 
- Demonstrate the part(s) you implemented. For the remaining parts, just provide an explanation. 



Individual Reflection 

Each student must submit a separate reflection document answering the following: 

1. If you worked individually, why did you choose to go solo? What challenges did you encounter? 
2. If you did it as a group, how were tasks distributed, and what was your specific task? What challenges did you encounter? 
3. Explain in your own words the advantages and disadvantages of using cloud services for implementing and deploying machine learning applications. You can use the application you selected for this project as a reference in your answer. 



Submission 

Submissions are done through the provided links in Blackboard. There are three links: 

1. Group report (one submission per group): 8%
